# Serverless Emailing using AWS

this project can be used to send emails to senders using AWS. This is better than a normal email since we can schedule or trigger emails according to our demand. We have to keep in mind that the two tools that are used in this project are Amazon Simple Emailing Service (SES) and AWS Lambda.
